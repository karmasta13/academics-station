This includes all of the coursework I was thankful for and loved creating. Even if the majority of them are not applicable in a real-world context, I was able to get basic knowledge from these courseworks.Some of them are linked below: 

* [Karmasta Music Store <span style="color:lightgrey">`XML`</span>](https://github.com/karmasta13/Academics/tree/main/Karmasta%20Music%20Store)  : This coursework was assigned to us in second year, and we were to design a system for a music store using XML development. This website is simply a prototype for a hypothetical company looking to build a website.

* [Berkeley College System <span style="color:lightgrey">`SQL`  `C#`](https://github.com/karmasta13/Academics/tree/main/berkeley): In this coursework, the database system has been developed and designed for a hypothetical college, Berkeley college. According to the case study, the college requires the development of a web-based system capable of performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions, as well as a manual to assist users in properly using the system.
